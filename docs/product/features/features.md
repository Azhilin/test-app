# Features — AI Adoption Metrics Report

User-visible features of the browser UI and generated reports. Update this file whenever a
tab, control, or report section is added, changed, or removed.

---

## Browser UI

The UI is a single-page application served by `app/server/` at `http://localhost:8080`.
It is the primary interface for configuring credentials, managing filters, and generating reports.

### Tabs

| Tab | ID | Default |
|-----|----|---------|
| Generate Report | `panel-generate` | yes (opens on load) |
| Filter Builder | `panel-filter` | — |
| Jira Connection | `panel-connection` | — |
| Jira Field Schema | `panel-schema` | — |

---

### Generate Report tab

The main workflow tab. Triggers report generation and displays live output.

#### Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Saved Filter** dropdown | Selects the JQL filter used to scope sprint issues. Populated from `config/jira_filters.json`. Required — the Generate button stays disabled until a filter is selected. |
| **Generate Report** button | Runs `python main.py` on the server and streams stdout/stderr as Server-Sent Events into the output panel. |
| **Report Options** (collapsible) | Expands to reveal per-run configuration. |

#### Report Options panel

| Option | Values | Default | Persisted |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Project Type** radio | Scrum / Kanban | Scrum | `localStorage` |
| **Estimation Type** radio | Story Points / Jira Tickets | Story Points | `localStorage` |
| **Metric Sections** checkboxes | Velocity Trend, AI Assistance Trend, AI Usage Details, DAU Survey, DAU Trend | all enabled | `localStorage` |

At least one metric section must be enabled; the Generate button is disabled when all are unchecked.

#### AI Adoption Labels card

Inline configuration for the Jira labels used by AI metrics. Changes are saved to `.env` via
`POST /api/config`.

| Field | Env var | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| AI Assisted Label | `AI_ASSISTED_LABEL` | Label that marks an issue as AI-assisted (default: `AI_assistance`) |
| Exclude Labels | `AI_EXCLUDE_LABELS` | Comma-separated labels excluded from the AI % denominator |
| Tool Labels | `AI_TOOL_LABELS` | Labels identifying AI tools (e.g. `AI_Tool_Copilot,AI_Tool_ChatGPT`) |
| Action Labels | `AI_ACTION_LABELS` | Labels identifying AI use-cases (e.g. `AI_Case_CodeGen,AI_Case_Review`) |

#### Output panel

Live SSE output from the generation subprocess. Displays each stdout/stderr line as it is
produced. Shows a success or error banner on completion.

#### Last Generated Reports list

Lists all previously generated reports under `generated/reports/`, sorted newest first.
Each entry is a clickable link to the corresponding `report.html`.

### Filter Builder tab

Create and manage named JQL filters that scope which Jira issues are included in a report.
Filters are stored in `config/jira_filters.json` and appear in the Generate Report dropdown.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Filter list | All saved filters, with the default filter always first |
| Add / edit filter | Name, JIRA Board ID, optional project key, optional label constraints |
| Delete filter | Removes any non-default user filter |
| Default filter protection | The default filter cannot be deleted via the UI |

---

### Jira Connection tab

Configures and verifies the Jira Cloud connection. Settings are saved to `.env` via
`POST /api/config`.

| Section | Controls |
|---------|----------|
| **Credentials** | Jira URL, Jira Email, API Token (masked); Save and Test Connection buttons |
| **Sprint Settings** | Board ID (optional), Sprint Count; saved to `config/defaults.env` |
| **SSL Certificate** | Certificate status badge (Valid / Expired / No certificate); Fetch Certificate and Remove Certificate buttons |

The **Test Connection** button proxies a credential check to `JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/myself`
with a 12-second timeout and reports success or HTTP error status.

---

### Jira Field Schema tab

Manages the Jira field schema used to locate story-points and status fields on each instance.
Schemas are stored in `config/jira_schema.json`.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Schema list | All saved schemas; `Default_Jira_Cloud` is always available as fallback |
| Create / edit schema | Schema name, story-points field ID, done/in-progress status lists |
| Delete schema | Removes any non-default schema entry |
| Active schema selection | The active schema name is read from `JIRA_SCHEMA_NAME` in `.env` |

---

## Generated Reports

Each `python main.py` run writes to `generated/reports/<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>/`:

| File | Format | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `report.html` | HTML | Self-contained, fully inline (CSS + Chart.js + data). Opens in any browser without a server. |
| `report.md` | Markdown | Plain-text summary with ASCII bar charts and tables. |

### Report sections

Each section can be independently toggled via the **Metric Sections** checkboxes in the UI
(or via `METRIC_*` env vars for CLI runs).

| Section | Toggle | HTML | Markdown | Description |
|---------|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Velocity Trend** (or **Throughput Trend** for Kanban) | `METRIC_VELOCITY` | bar chart + running-average line | ASCII bar chart + table | Story points (or issue count) of done issues per sprint |
| **AI Assistance Trend** | `METRIC_AI_TREND` | line chart + per-sprint table | table | Per-sprint % of done story points carrying the AI-assisted label |
| **AI Usage Details** | `METRIC_AI_USAGE` | two donut/bar charts (tools + use-cases) | tables | Breakdown of AI tool labels and AI use-case labels across AI-assisted issues |
| **DAU Survey** | `METRIC_DAU` | team-average card + by-role table + usage-frequency bar chart | summary + by-role table | Team Daily Active Usage average from self-reported survey data |
| **DAU Trend** | `METRIC_DAU_TREND` | combo bar+line chart (avg days + adoption %) | ASCII bar chart + table | Week-over-week DAU average and adoption percentage |

### Label adaptation

Report column headers and chart labels adapt to the selected **Project Type** and
**Estimation Type**:

| Project Type | Velocity section title | Period column |
|---|---|---|
| Scrum | Velocity trend | Sprint |
| Kanban | Throughput trend | Period |

| Estimation Type | Velocity unit label |
|---|---|
| Story Points | points |
| Jira Tickets | issues (count of done issues) |
